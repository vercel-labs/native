// @native-sdk/core/events — the canonical event record types the host and
// markup deliver into an app core, an SDK LIBRARY module: pure type
// declarations in the app-core subset, emitted into your core when imported
// and absent when not. Under node the same file resolves as-is.
//
// Every record here matches, field for field, the structural shape a
// runtime matcher expects — markup's `on-input`/`on-scroll` mirrors
// (`declaredTextInputUnion`/`declaredScrollStateRecord`), the generated
// wiring's channel builders (`frameMsg`/`keyMsg`/`appearanceMsg`/
// `chromeMsg`), and the audio event arm validator. Matching stays
// STRUCTURAL either way (type identity cannot cross the emission
// boundary), so declaring the same shape in your own core remains legal;
// these exports exist so no core has to re-type the vocabulary and no
// hand-rolled mirror can drift. One home per type: the text-input family
// lives with the byte-splice engine in `@native-sdk/core/text` and is
// re-exported here, so `@native-sdk/core/events` resolves every event
// record an app binds. (Importing this module pulls `./text.ts` into the
// emitted core with it; unused engine functions cost source lines, never
// binary — Zig compiles only what the core references.)
//
// Names are unique across a core's whole module graph (NS1038): a core
// that imports one of these types cannot also declare its own record
// under the same name — delete the in-file mirror and import it instead.
//
// How each type is bound:
//   - `TextInputEvent`, `ScrollState`: Msg-arm PAYLOAD fields —
//     `{ kind: "draft_edit"; edit: TextInputEvent }`,
//     `{ kind: "scrolled"; scroll: ScrollState }`.
//   - `FrameEvent`, `KeyEvent`, `PinchEvent`: the wiring channels'
//     parameter records — `frameMsg(model, frame: FrameEvent)`,
//     `keyMsg(key: KeyEvent)`, `pinchMsg(pinch: PinchEvent)`.
//   - `ColorScheme`, `ChromeInsets`, `ChromeButtons`, `AudioState`: field
//     types INSIDE the arm records the `appearanceMsg`/`chromeMsg`/audio
//     routes name (the arms themselves stay inline unions of `kind` plus
//     the event's fields — the subset has no intersection arms).
//   - `AppearanceEvent`, `ChromeEvent`, `AudioEvent`: the full arm
//     payload shapes, canonical and importable for helper signatures
//     (an arm value is structurally assignable to its event record).
